# Save and Retrieve Images In the Database (mysql)
Generally, when we upload image file in PHP, the uploaded image is stored in a directory of the server and the respective image name is stored in the database. 
At the time of display, the file is retrieved from the server and the image is rendered on the web page.
If youâ€™re concerned about the server space and need free space on your server, 
you can insert the image file directly in the database without uploading it to the directory of the server.

Always consider the pro and cons of storing the images in the database.
